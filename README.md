# Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA)
## Compile
### One of the following commands will compile the simple genetic algorithm executable/s in the downloaded folder.
<pre><code> 
make
make sga2
make sga3
</code></pre>
### Executing *make* without any arguments will compile respective SGA binaries for both the sample objective function codes, *obj2.c* and *obj3.c*, as *sga2* and *sga3*.
## Run
### The compiled code is run by writing an objective function to be optimised by SGA in *C*, two such sample objective function codes are provided in the downloaded folder. 
### *sga3.var* contains the SGA parameters. These are explained in **Simple Genetic Algorithm Explainer.pdf** [Section 4].
