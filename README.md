# Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA)
## Compile
##### One of the following commands will compile the simple genetic algorithm executable in the downloaded folder.
<pre><code> 
make sga2
make sga3
</code></pre>
##### The SGA binaries for the sample objective function codes, *obj2.c* and *obj3.c*, will be *sga2* and *sga3* respectively.
## Run
##### The compiled code is run by writing an objective function to be optimised by SGA in *C*, two such sample objective function codes are provided in the downloaded folder. 
##### File *sga3.var* contains the SGA parameters. These are explained in **Simple Genetic Algorithm Explainer.pdf** [Section 4]. Results are stored in *genout.dat*.

## Acknowledgement
##### This C code is based upon D.E. Goldberg's PASCAL code in 1989 ed. of Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimisation and Machine Learning.
